		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p> The challenge of this lab was to use conditionals in JavaScript
      to create a program that took the user's input and sorted it by the amount of letters
      in the name by % 4. Depending on the remainder, you coukd be drafted by the Lakers, Warriors, Heat
    or Celtics.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p> I decided to try this lab using jQuery opposed to normal JavaScript. It
    was difficult setting up the functions at first because I couldn't use the
  professors screenshots as guides but through trial and error I figured it out. </p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p> The results of the lab are below. Just enter your name and a team will draft you! <p/>
