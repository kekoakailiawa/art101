		<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
		<p>The subject of this lab was to create a local file strcuture
			on my compter and add index.html files. I also started working on
			my website.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>The most challeging part of this lab for me was the actual typing
			process of the HTML files. The HTML tags and how to close them were tricky
			at first but I got a hang of it once I kept doing it over and over again.</p>
		<h2>Results and screenshots</h2>
		<p>Here are the screenshots that we turned in for this lab:<p/>
