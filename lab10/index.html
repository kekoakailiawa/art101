		<h1>Lab 10 - JavaScript Events and Forms </h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p> The challenge of this lab was to create a JavaScript event from a form we
    enter our name into. The function of the event then sorted the user's input in a
    randomized manner. I copied the professors anagram() function from his Lab 10
    because I thought it was really ineteresting.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p> The biggest problem I had was actually remembering the order of the syntax.
        I had to to keep referring to the lecture and the slack/jsfiddle example because I couldn't remember
        the order of the syntax for the javascript code. </p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>JavaScript should take your name and re-arrange it into another name! The
      results will be under the script output section. <p/>
