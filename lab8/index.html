		<h1>Lab 8 - Anon functions and Callbacks </h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p> The challenges of this lab was to create an array assigned to a variable, carry out a function, experiment with
      anonymous functions and callbacks. I did an addition function and then a function that told me if my array had even or odd numbers. </p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p> I had no real problems with this lab, but it just took me a second to really understand the specific syntax and how it worked.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p> The results of the lab are located in the console.<p/>
