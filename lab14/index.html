    <h3>Debugging</h3>
    <p> The issue with Lab 13 was the order of my synatx in my js, which affected my output.
    As I was looking through this lab, I realized that my multiples of 15, 21, and 35 weren't
    showing a fizzbuzz, fizzboom, or buzzboom combination. It was only showing me the first multiple!
    So I went and reordered my syntax because I remember Professor Wes mentioning how the combination multiples
    should be placed in order from greatest to least. I didn't do any specific debugging method, other than refer to my notes
    and remember out of the blue.
