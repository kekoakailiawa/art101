		<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problemsolving</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p> Challenges which we faced within this lab, was understanding the precode tag functioned
		and also what a pseudocode was, and how we could transform it into comments via JS. However,
	  we were able to tackle these problems with a quick google search, and looking at the examples
    provided by the instructions.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p> Some problems we encountered in this lab were the clarity of the directions and our understanding
		of them. We weren't sure if we should turn both our pseudocode tasks into comments or just our computer
	task but other than that this lab was pretty straightforward. </p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Here is a numbered list for our everyday task we chose for this lab: Setting up a Roku Express.<p/>
			<ol>
				<li>Unbox Roku Express carefully and separate the cables from the Roku receiver box </li>
				<li>Connect HDMI and power source cables to Roku receiver box </li>
				<li>Connect the Roku receiver box to TV power source or power outlet </li>
				<li>Put the Roku receiver somewhere around the TV </li>
				<li>Connect Roku to local internet via remote controls and signing in to Wifi network </li>
				<li>Set up Roku with personalized streaming services/channels and enjoy </li>

			</ol>

		<p>Here is a numbered list for computer task: rock, paper, scissors.
			<ol>
				<li>Show board </li>
				<li>Accept User Input </li>
				<li>Confirm User Input</li>
				<li>Randomize Computer Choice </li>
				<li>Evaluate Outcome </li>
				<li>Win, Loss, Tie </li>
  <pre><code>
		//Showboard
		//Accept User Input
		//Confirm User Input
		//Randomize Computer Choice
		//Evaluate Outcome
		//Win, Loss, Tie
  </pre></code>
