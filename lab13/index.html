  		<h1>Lab 13 - Loops </h1>
  		<h2>Challenges</h2>
  		<p>The challenge of this lab was to create loops. The loop involved
    numbers 1 to 200 and for every multiple of 3, 5, and 7 there should be a
  fun word replacing the number. </p>
  		<h2>Problems</h2>
  		<p> A lot of my problems were just syntax problems. I forgot to call my function also
      which really stumped me until my partner helped me. </p>
  		<h2>Results</h2>
  		<p> The results of the lab are below. Fizz = *3, Buzz = *5, Boom = *7  <p/>
